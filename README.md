Fitness Tracker Machine Learning
Overview
The Fitness Tracker Machine Learning project is a Python-based application that leverages machine learning techniques to automate exercise repetition counting using accelerometer and gyroscope data. This project aims to enhance the workout experience by providing users with an automated and accurate rep counting system, reducing the need for manual input during workouts.

Project Highlights
Engineered a machine learning algorithm achieving a notable accuracy rate of 96% in recognizing and tallying exercise repetitions, eliminating manual input requirements.
Orchestrated the research, processing, querying, and analysis of a comprehensive dataset comprising 1000+ workouts and 200,000+ repetitions to meticulously train the algorithm.

Key Functionalities
Automatic Rep Counting: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to autonomously learn and identify movement patterns for automatic rep counting during exercises.
